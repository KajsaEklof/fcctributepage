                        the bill. Although the bill was never resurrected, Pankhurst considered it a successful
                        demonstration of militancy's power to capture attention.[59] Pankhurst declared in 1906: "We
                        are at last recognized as a political party; we are now in the swim of politics, and are a
                        political force.</p>
